**Bun is a fast JavaScript all-in-one toolkit**

### setup

```console
$ curl https://bun.sh/install | bash

$ exec /bin/zsh
```


### Why is Bun Fast
``` 
The Bun runtime exhibits impressive speed due to several key factors:

Lightweight Design: Bun is designed to be lightweight, resulting in a smaller codebase and reduced resource requirements.
This optimized design allows Bun to deliver better performance in terms of both speed and memory usage compared to other runtimes.

Low-Level Implementation: The Bun runtime is built using Zig, a relatively new low-level programming language.
Zig's characteristics enable developers to write code with fine-grained control over memory management and execution,
contributing to the runtime's efficiency.

Performance Optimization: Instead of relying on the V8 engine, Bun utilizes the JavaScriptCore from WebKit,
which is widely recognized for its superior performance. By leveraging this core engine, Bun benefits from its optimized execution of JavaScript code,
resulting in improved runtime speed.

Integrated Functionality: Bun offers native tools and features that streamline the development process.
It includes a built-in bundler, replacing the need for external tools like Webpack, as well as a native transpiler that supports writing TypeScript code directly. Additionally,
Bun incorporates a test runner similar to Jest and automatically loads environment variables without requiring additional installations of packages like dotenv.
